"""Common base class for sandboxes.

This module provides an base class `BaseSandbox` for sandboxes, which takes care
of the sandbox lifecycle and housekeeping. It also provides a decorator for
sandbox service methods to handle errors and trigger shutdowns. Please note that
this base class is intended to provide a convenient way to implement sandboxes,
and not all sandbox implementations need to subclass it. Also `BaseSandbox`
is not coupled with `BaseEnvironment` and `BaseFeature`, and is expected to
work with the `Environment` and `Feature` interfaces directly.
