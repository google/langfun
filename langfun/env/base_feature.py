"""Common base class for sandbox-based features.

This module provides an base class `BaseFeature` for sandbox-based features,
which provides event handlers for the feature lifecycle events, which can be
overridden by subclasses to provide custom behaviors. Please note that this base
class is intended to provide a convenient way to implement features, and not
all feature implementations need to subclass it. Also `BaseFeature` is not
coupled with `BaseEnvironment` and `BaseSandbox`, and is expected to work with
the `Environment` and `Sandbox` interfaces directly.
