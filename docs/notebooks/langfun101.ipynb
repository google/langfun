        "Effective programming of Large Language Models (LLMs) demands a seamless integration of natural language text with structured data. Langfun, leveraging [PyGlove](https://github.com/google/pyglove)'s symbolic objects, provides a simple yet powerful interface for mapping between Python objects with the assistance of LLMs. The input/output objects may include natural language texts (in string form), structured data (objects of a specific class), modalities (such as images), and more. The unified API for accomplishing all conceivable mappings is [`lf.query`](https://github.com/google/langfun/blob/145f4a48603d2e6e19f9025e032ac3c86dfd3e35/langfun/core/structured/prompting.py#L103).\n"
